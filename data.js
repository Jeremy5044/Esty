These vintage book prints make awesome unique gifts and are environmentally responsible. \r\n\r\nEach print is on a different page of vintage dictionary paper, so no two are exactly alike. One of the great things about prints on antique book pages is not only the beauty and making for an interesting read but it also upcycles books giving them new life. In the spirit of recycling we use book pages for our prints that may have character flaws with some spotting, uneven printing and occasional corner bending. All our dictionary pages have that beautiful golden patina color that only comes from age. The result is a unique and absolutely beautiful print suitable for framing. These prints are definite conversation starters and look gorgeous while hanging on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n:: PAPER SIZE ::\r\nPaper is approximately 8\u201d x 10 1\/2\u201d in size, with a very slight variation, perfect for an 8x10 frame or a standard 11x14 mat with an opening for an 8x10 print.\r\n\r\n\r\n:: SHIPPING ::\r\nThe print will be packaged in a clear plastic sleeve and a sturdy cardboard mailer for shipping via USPS First Class Mail. Orders are mailed within 1-3 business days after payment. \r\n\r\n\r\n:: UPGRADES ::\r\nCanvas reproductions available here:\r\nwww.etsy.com\/listing\/102089382\r\n\r\n\r\n:: NOTES :: \r\nItems do not come matted and do not come in frame.

We suggest contacting for a price to ship via UPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen your order ships, you will receive a convo from us telling you how the package has shipped.\r\n\r\nWe determine if orders are shipping via US Mail or UPS depending on the weight and size of the object being shipped.  \r\n\r\nWhen we ship by UPS, we have a tracking number provided to us and we pass that number on to you via convo.\r\n\r\nWhen we ship via US Mail we most often receive a tracking number, but not always..  If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.","policy_refunds":"Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel.

If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage.  We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product.  If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable.  This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable.  We do not want any of our products in use if thy are not up to our standards for quality.  We will instruct you how marr and photograph the item.\r\n\r\nIf a proof is requested, and a mistake is found after production, there will not be a refund if the proof was approved by the customer.\r\n\r\nAll engraving\/production\/delivery information or other information required to complete and deliver the order must be indicated in the ORDER NOTES at checkout.

I see more and more true craftsmanship and quality lost with the desire to turn a quick profit on an inferior product as time goes on.   I also  truly believe in the old adage that one man&#39;s trash is another man&#39;s treasure. This moves me to try to find a home or use for anything possible before tossing it in a landfill. I love to see things used and enjoyed , not just sitting and collecting dust. Even as four of my children have married and I have three grandchildren, I still enjoy buying and selling, enjoying so many unique items even if just briefly until they sell. I&#39;m thrilled when my buyers absolutely love their purchase. Ecstatic feedback just makes my day!

Due to the fact that I am in Florida , I have to allow for shipping to California which can make it appear higher for other, closer locations. If there is a difference of $2.00 or more , I will issue a partial shipping refund. I round the actual shipping costs to the dollar and refund any overage.  If it is a large item going thru Greyhound , distance will make no difference, they go primarily by weight and size. Also sometimes if you are closer to me it may mean that I can ship it thru UPS or FedEx for the same cost and save you a trip to the Greyhound station. I do not add any charges for packing materials and try to pack green (reuse good packing materials as much as possible) but never risk damage to your item. My buyer&#39;s time in searching out and purchasing an item is precious to me and shipping insurance does not reimburse for that or replace the beautiful item lost. I know the cost of shipping is very frustrating but I do my best to keep it as low as possible and do not profit off of the shipping. FedEx , UPS and Greyhound all require a phone number in case they have trouble delivering your package to you, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER WHEN PURCHASING.","policy_refunds":"My items are vintage or distressed for the most part and rarely perfect. I do my best to describe them accurately and disclose any flaws either in the description or through my pictures.

I don&#39;t offer a general return policy but it I have missed something or made a mistake I will take care of it . Feel free to contact me with any issues.
